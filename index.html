        <h6>Chapter 1: The Disparity in the World</h6>
          <img src="images/ofinschool.png">
          <h5>Globally 88% of girls and 91% of boys are enrolled in school, this may sound relatively equal but the 3% of girls missing out 
          on school altogether is approximately 240,750,000 million girls.</h5>
      </div>
          <p>The difference in education parity between 1st and 3rd world countries is striking, further down the rabbit hole the gaps are 
          starker in FCV countries (affected by Fragility, Conflict, and Violence). Here, girls are 2.5 times more likely to receive no 
          education than boys in the same country. Some countries even ban the attendance of girls or restrict the right to education of 
          married, pregnant and parenting girls and women in their legal framework.</p>
          <br>

          <h5>“But what about men?”<br>“What about boys?”</h5>
      <div id="BO">
          <img src="images/dotgraph.png">
          <p>These are common responses to work for girls’ and women’s empowerment. In most cases, these responses do not come with an 
          understanding of the different situations of women and men, girls and boys, where girls and women usually have less resources, 
          opportunities and are more vulnerable to losing their rights. </p> 
          <p>It is important to contextualize this issue as not a girls vs boys but understand that to properly establish the human right of 
          education for girls is to provide safety and equality for ALL. Ignoring the overarching education gap between developed and 
          developing countries is ignoring the full picture. While girls have more difficulty accessing education, boys are more likely 
          to repeat primary grades in 130 countries and are most commonly out of school due to failure in school. Globally, 128 million
          boys are out of school. Closing this divide from both sides is paramount to the overall health of both women and children.
          Gender inequality in education highlights the devastating development inequalities in the world.</p>
      </div>

          <h5>Why is that?</h5>
      <div id="MAP">
          <img src="images/hapi-map.png">
          <p>To understand the relation between development and gender inequality in education I will be using the Happiness Index Score. This 
          is a studied measure of a country's happiness. This is done through a survey of a typical annual sample of 
          1,000 people for each country, then is measured for three years for the final score. It measures life satisfaction in the domains 
          of psychological well-being, health, time balance, community, social support, environment, standard of living, government, work, 
          education, arts and culture. While taking in account the levels of GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom, and 
          corruption within a country. The best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0. The graphs below 
          show as the score gets lower the range of disparity increases. </p>

          <p class="cap">Generally the highest rates of parity (equalness) in education is in primary school, as education level increases the parity decreases.
            <br>*Disparity = the calculated difference between the percentage of girls and boys who have completed this level of education</p>

      <p>Education represents opportunity. At all ages, education intentionally engages the receptive capacities of children and others to imbue them 
      with knowledge, skills of reasoning, values, socio-emotional awareness and control, and social interaction, so they can grow as engaged, productive, 
      creative, and self-governing members of a society. It is also a key driver for reducing poverty, fostering economic growth, achieving gender 
      equality, and social development. These benefits are even greater when support for education is targeted toward girls. Without education, too many 
      children may be led into social dysfunction and marginal living conditions with lifelong disadvantages.</p>

      <p>For the sake of brevity I will be focusing on child mortality and maternal mortality, education provides stability in multiple areas of health such 
        as dimishing exposure to prostitution, physical/sexual violence, HIV, overcoming trauma caused by war, disaster, or conflict. I am measuring the 
        correlation between  child mortality and maternal mortality by lower education because those deprived of basic education for one would not move on 
        to upper secondary education but secondly, are largely more susceptible to death.</p>
      </div>

    <div id="FIVE">
      <img src="images/50-graph.png">
    <h5>A child born to a mother who can read is 50% more likely to survive past age 5. Each extra year of a mother’s schooling reduces the probability of 
      infant mortality by 5% to 10%</h5>
      <p>Empowerment through education is one of the strongest antidotes to maternal risk. A positive relationship between women’s education and maternal 
        health is well documented. Studies employing exogenous sources of variation have confirmed that women’s education influences demographic behaviors 
        related to reproductive health. These studies have shown, for example, that improving women’s access to schooling decreases their desired and 
        realized fertility, delays their sexual debut, and improves their ability to negotiate sex. Women with higher levels of education are more likely 
        to delay and space out pregnancies, and to seek health care and support. Complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death 
        and disability among women, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives each year. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ATE">
      <img src="images/18-graph.png">
    <h5> ¼ to ½ of the girls in developing countries become mothers before they are 18.</h5>
      <p>Education is strongly associated with lower levels of child mortality and better nutrition and health for their children. Improvements in the health 
        of pregnant women and new mothers will play an important role in generating further reductions in child mortality. Poor nutrition in women can lead 
        to preterm births and babies with low-birth weight. The evidence also shows that children who lose their mothers are more likely to die before their 
        second birthday than those whose mothers survive. Evidence indicates that when girls with at least a basic education reach adulthood, they are more 
        likely than those without an education to manage the size of their families according to their capacities, and are more likely to provide better 
        care for their children and send them to school.</p>
